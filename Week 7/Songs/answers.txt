If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, their audio aura could be characterized as energetic, upbeat, and emotionally positive. This is because many popular songs tend to have relatively high energy and danceability values, which suggests that the listener enjoys lively, rhythmic music. If the average valence is also moderately high, it indicates that the songs generally convey positive or happy emotions rather than sadness or calmness. Overall, the listener’s music taste appears to favor engaging and mood-boosting tracks rather than slow or melancholic ones.

However, calculating an audio aura using only the average energy, danceability, and valence of the top 100 songs may not be very representative of the listener’s true music preferences. Averages can hide important variations, such as the listener enjoying both very calm songs and very energetic songs, which would be flattened into a single middle value. Additionally, the top 100 songs may reflect what the listener played most frequently, not necessarily the full range of music they enjoy. External factors like parties, workouts, or social trends may also influence which songs are played more often during a particular year.

A better way to calculate an audio aura would be to consider the distribution of these audio features instead of just their averages. For example, Spotify could analyze how often a listener plays high-energy versus low-energy songs, or cluster songs into different mood categories such as “chill,” “happy,” “intense,” or “sad.” Weighting songs by recency or play context could also improve accuracy. These approaches would provide a more nuanced and personalized representation of a listener’s music taste than simple averages.
